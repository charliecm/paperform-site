					Going beyond the grid.
				</h3>
				<p>
					While there’s lots of apps out there like <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/" target="_blank">Pinterest</a>, <a href="https://support.invisionapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205249269-Introduction-to-Boards" target="_blank">InVision Boards</a>, or <a href="https://niice.co" target="_blank">Niice</a>, they’re all grid-based image layout tools. They might be great for collecting and looking at your content, but they’re not so great for analytical or relational workflows. You can’t put images in groups or create your own ways of organizing them. We want to build a tool that would support and extend ways of thinking that are transient, cluttered or non-linear. By enabling a freeform approach to arrange images, we hope that users would surface patterns and insights organically.

					Looking at precedents
				</h3>
				<p>
					We looked into some existing research in the areas of visual analytics, digital whiteboarding and gestural multi-touch. What’s currently possible on modern touchscreen devices like the iPad are still quite limited. For example, nearly all interactions are composed of a tap or a swipe even though the hardware can detect 10 fingers in total. For this project we wanted to experiment with new and emerging interactions to see how well they fit into real workflows.

					We knew one of the most important interactions of the app to get right was making sure moving images was really fast and fluid. Rearranging images on the canvas should feel as easy as rearraging post-it notes on a whiteboard. We tried a bunch of ideas but narrowed it down to either a double tap to select or long press to select an image. During testing with 5 users, there wasn’t a clear winner but long press was more consistant with other interactions in the app.

					Tapping the Select icon in the toolbar activates multiselect mode. The user can tap or draw a lasso to select multiple images. The images can then be rearranged into a grid or placed into a stack. This is useful for organzing content into categories or hiding images in a folder.

					We give the user the ability to be messy with layout but also provide tools to quickly sort, group and organize images. Multiselection becomes essential in this workflow and we tested 3 ideas: procedural multiselect, toolbar tap and toolbar lasso. During testing, users had a difficult time discovering that multiselect was available during a single select. This was also due to a limitation in our prototypes that did not allow for gestures with 2 hands. Tapping on the Select button might take longer, but it’s also an explicit action that makes it much clearer to users that they were in a different mode.

					Getting images onto the canvas should be fast and straightforward without creating clutter. We experimented with a full screen import experience versus a smaller side panel design. The panel design afforded the ability to import and arrange on the canvas at the same time which in our testing nearly all users took advantage of. Originally the UI required users to tap on thumbnails to add images but there was a strong desire to drag, which in retrospect felt much more natural and precise.

					Retrospective
				</h3>
				<p>
					<strong>Charlie</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					Early in the project, James and I talked about experimenting with natural and innovative user interactions, given the topic of the course. We pivoted from designing a location scouting tool to a moodboarding app as we saw the opportunity to explore interactivity at a more fundamental level. Unfortunately, given the time we had, a lot of good ideas were cut to allow us to communicate the product clearly. Nevertheless, I thought the project was a success because we were able to ground our ideas through usability testing and multiple rounds of prototyping. The result is a fundamentally sound product that can be further developed.
				</p>
				<p>
					Perhaps the biggest learning point for me was learning how to conduct quick A/B tests with our users. We built many different variations of our prototypes for each tasks. The feedback we received helped us refine the interactions until they feel intuitive. In the end, I find this rigorous testing of very specific details very appropriate for the kind of product we were designing. In the future, I would use and streamline this process so that the design can be iterated more rapidly.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>James</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					I’m pretty happy with what we’ve been able to build in the past few weeks. Of course it would’ve been great if we had more time, especially during the refinement and testing stages. There were many ideas that were left on the cutting room floor such as annotation, collaboration and sharing and I wish we could have realized more of them. This was an ‘exploratory’ UI design project in the space between academia and consumer products and one of the major challenges was prototyping. Something as simple as interactions using two hands were almost impossible to test due to limitations in the prototyping software and with iOS itself. I would definitely invest more time in setting up an prototyping environment that’s conducive to rapid iteration.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the past I’ve mostly worked on pretty typical web and mobile UI design projects. In those cases the problems were typically workflow or context related versus with this project it was heavily focused on interactions. Something as basic as selecting an image with a double tap or a long tap turned out to be much harder problems than I expected. It really made me appreciate all the work Apple put into iPhone OS and all the new papers on multi-touch technologies. We might feel that smartphones have peaked or can’t innovate any further but in terms of UI design on touchscreens, there is still so much work to be done.
